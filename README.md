# Titanic-DataAnalysis
This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival.

# Titanic Data Analysis - Key Steps:

Data Loading & Preprocessing:

Load the Titanic dataset using Pandas.
Handle missing data (e.g., filling missing ages, dropping irrelevant columns).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data using Seaborn and Matplotlib to identify trends.
Analyze key features like age, gender, class, fare, and their impact on survival.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features like family size, title extraction (Mr., Mrs., etc.), and fare per person to enhance prediction.
Data Visualization:

Generate graphs to illustrate survival rates by passenger class, gender, and other features.
Model Building:

Apply machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict survival.
Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its accuracy using metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict survival chances for new or test data.

Conclusion:

Summarize insights: for example, women and children had a higher survival rate, and higher-class passengers were more likely to survive.
This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influenced survival during the Titanic disaster and offers predictive modeling to estimate survival chances.
